-- Module      :  Data.Active
-- Copyright   :  (c) 2011 Brent Yorgey
-- License     :  BSD-style (see LICENSE)
-- Maintainer  :  byorgey@cis.upenn.edu
--
-- Inspired by the work of Kevin Matlage and Andy Gill (/Every/
-- /Animation Should Have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End/, Trends
-- in Functional Programming,
-- 2010. <http://ku-fpg.github.io/files/Matlage-10-BeginningMiddleEnd.pdf>), this module defines a
-- simple abstraction for working with time-varying values.  A value
-- of type @Active a@ is either a constant value of type @a@, or a
-- time-varying value of type @a@ (/i.e./ a function from time to
-- @a@) with specific start and end times.  Since active values
-- have start and end times, they can be aligned, sequenced,
-- stretched, or reversed.
--
-- In a sense, this is sort of like a stripped-down version of
-- functional reactive programming (FRP), without the reactivity.
--
-- The original motivating use for this library is to support making
-- animations with the diagrams framework
-- (<https://diagrams.github.io>), but the hope is that it
-- may find more general utility.
--
-- There are two basic ways to create an @Active@ value.  The first is
-- to use 'mkActive' to create one directly, by specifying a start and
-- end time and a function of time.  More indirectly, one can use the
-- 'Applicative' instance together with the unit interval 'ui', which
-- takes on values from the unit interval from time 0 to time 1, or
-- 'interval', which creates an active over an arbitrary interval.
--
-- For example, to create a value of type @Active Double@ which
-- represents one period of a sine wave starting at time 0 and ending
-- at time 1, we could write
--
-- > mkActive 0 1 (\t -> sin (fromTime t * tau))
--
-- or
--
-- > (sin . (*tau)) <$> ui
--
-- 'pure' can also be used to create @Active@ values which are
-- constant and have no start or end time.  For example,
--
-- > mod <$> (floor <$> interval 0 100) <*> pure 7
--
-- cycles repeatedly through the numbers 0-6.
--
-- Note that the \"idiom bracket\" notation supported by the SHE
-- preprocessor (<http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~conor/pub/she/>,
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/she>) can make for somewhat
-- more readable 'Applicative' code.  For example, the above example
-- can be rewritten using SHE as
--
-- > {-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF she #-}
-- >
-- > ... (| mod (| floor (interval 0 100) |) ~7 |)
--
-- There are many functions for transforming and composing active
-- values; see the documentation below for more details.
--
--
-- With careful handling, this module should be suitable to generating
-- deep embeddings if 'Active' values.

--  Active
------------------------------------------------------------

-- $active
-- For working with time-varying values, it is convenient to have an
-- 'Applicative' instance: '<*>' lets us apply time-varying
-- functions to time-varying values; 'pure' allows treating constants
-- as time-varying values which do not vary.  However, as explained in
-- its documentation, 'Dynamic' cannot be made an instance of
-- 'Applicative' since there is no way to implement 'pure'.  The
-- problem is that all 'Dynamic' values must have a finite start and
-- end time.  The solution is to adjoin a special constructor for
-- pure/constant values with no start or end time, giving us 'Active'.

-- | There are two types of @Active@ values:
--
--   * An 'Active' can simply be a 'Dynamic', that is, a time-varying
--     value with start and end times.
--
--   * An 'Active' value can also be a constant: a single value,
--     constant across time, with no start and end times.
--
--   The addition of constant values enable 'Monoid' and 'Applicative'
--   instances for 'Active'.

-- | @ui@ represents the /unit interval/, which takes on the value @t@

--
--   <<diagrams/src_Data_Active_uiDia.svg#diagram=uiDia&width=200>>
--
--   On the x-axis is time, and the value that @ui@ takes on is on the
--   y-axis.  The shaded portion represents the era.  Note that the
--   value of @ui@ (as with any active) is still defined outside its
--   era, and this can make a difference when it is combined with
